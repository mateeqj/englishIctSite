				Have you ever had a teacher who saw something special in you, even when you didn’t see it yourself? For our Grade 8 class, Ms. Jeanen Villareal was that teacher. She didn’t just teach us lessons, she helped us find the confidence we didn’t know we had.<br><br>Ms. Villareal was a strict and stern teacher, but she made the class feel safe and supported. Even when most of them didn’t like listening to teachers, she remained patient and never gave up on them. She believed that each student had potential, and she showed it through her words and actions. One example is when she encouraged Seth Pastelero to join the dance troupe, a push that helped him gain confidence to audition for the dance troupe. Seth was able to get in and even became a dance leader for Lux Oriens which helped Lux Oriens win best drama and 1st runner up for Dance Palabas. Her belief in her class helped many of them believe in themselves, and that’s something they’ll always be thankful for.<br><br>Ms. Villareal showed them that confidence doesn’t come from being perfect, but from having someone believe in you even when you don’t believe in yourself. Her patience and support helped shape not just their skills, but their courage to face challenges. Because of her, they learned that sometimes all it takes is one person’s faith to change the way they see themselves forever.
